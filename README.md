# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Dashboard | Power BI

## 🧠 Problem Statement

**PhoneNow**, a telecom service provider, has observed a rise in customer churn, impacting revenue and long-term sustainability. The company wants to identify:

- Who is churning and why?
- Which customer segments are most at risk?
- What services or account attributes correlate with churn?
- How can data-driven strategies improve retention?

I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze churn behavior and support strategic decision-making to improve retention.
